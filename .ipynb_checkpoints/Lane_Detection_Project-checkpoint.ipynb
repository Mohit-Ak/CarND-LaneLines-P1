    "The project has been implemented to identify lane lines on the road.  A pipeline processing is applied to a series of individual images and ultimately a video stream. All the images from \"test_images\" are read and and processed. All videos from \"test_videos\" directory are read and processed. Ultimately, one line is drawn for the left side of the lane, and one for the right hand side. The corresponding outputs are written to test_images_output and test_videos_output directory.\n",
